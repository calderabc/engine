A tile based puzzle game engine (in development) programmed in Java.

So far basic tetris and columns games implemented with Java Swing for display.

Requires Java SE 8 JDK or equivalent (with Swing).

I haven't yet added build scripts.

The executable is engine.puzzle.PuzzleGame
(/engine/src/engine/puzzle/PuzzleGame.java).

The executable requires two arguments:
[which game] [which display engine]

(The only functioning combinations):
Tetris Swing
Columns Swing
